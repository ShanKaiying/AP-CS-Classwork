##Class
A class is a software blueprint for implementing objects of a given type. An object is a single instance of the class. In a program there will often be several different instances of a given class type.
##Object
Reference variable; instance of a class
##Attribute
Instance or static variable in a class
##Behavior
Methdos in a class
##Encapsulation: hiding the attribute and behavior of an object and show the interface.

##Constructor: 
<br>A constructor creates an object of the class. Having several constructors provides different ways of initializing class objects. For example, there are two constructors in the BankAccount class.

##Invoke: 
<br>call a method

##Getter Methods: 
<br>get the value of an attribute(variable)

##Setter methods: 
<br>set the value of an attribute.
