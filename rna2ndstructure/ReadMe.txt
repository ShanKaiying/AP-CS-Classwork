The portable app does not require installation. Make as many copies as you need. Carry it in a flash drive and use on any computer, even without administrator access. No change of any setting on the host computer. No more conflicts with other applications. No more 'hijacking' of file types.

The portable app creates a sandbox folder in its current location. So the location of the portable app should have read-write access. (You cannot use the app when its location has read-only access. eg. A CD/DVD drive or a read-only network location.) If you face any problems using the app, just delete the sandbox folder and start over again.

WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET FALSE ALERTS:
Some Antiviruses (AV) are likely to give a false alert (false positive) for this portable app OR the files in the sandbox folder created by this portable app. If you face this problem, try submitting the file under suspicion for a deep analysis on your AV's website (alternatively, you can use the User Interface of your AV for submitting the file under suspicion). You can also provide your AV, the link for downloading the portable app (from the Rapidshare linklist above) in case your AV is unable to give a verdict based on the sandbox files alone.
